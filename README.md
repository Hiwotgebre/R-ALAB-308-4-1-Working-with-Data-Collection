# JavaScript Data Processing Lab

## Introduction
This graded assignment involves creating two different data processing algorithms. The first stage transforms raw data into a formatted array of objects according to a specification. The second stage uses the output from the first stage to provide a textual report on the data.

## Objectives
- Use arrays to store ordered lists of data.
- Use objects to store keyed lists of data.
- Use conditional logic to process data.
- Use loops to handle repetitive tasks.
- Transform data according to specifications.

## Instructions
1. Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder.
2. Create a JavaScript file (`index.js`) to contain your code.
3. Complete the activities specified below.
4. Commit your code frequently.
5. Submit a GitHub link to your completed project repository.

## Activities

### Part 1: Refactoring Old Code
Refactor the code from ALAB 308.3.1 to use arrays and objects for better readability and efficiency.

### Part 2: Expanding Functionality
- Declare a variable that stores the number of columns in each row of data within the CSV.
- Store the results in a two-dimensional array.
- Cache this array in a variable for later use.

### Part 3: Transforming Data
- Transform each row into an object with keys as the headings.
- Store these objects in an array.

### Part 4: Sorting and Manipulating Data
- Remove the last element from the array.
- Insert an object at index 1.
- Add an object to the end of the array.
- Calculate the average age of the group.

### Part 5: Full Circle
- Transform the final set of data back into CSV format.
